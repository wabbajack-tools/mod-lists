## What is Keizaal?

A few criteria for the mods on this list:

1. **The modlist is lite and intends to maintain the Vanilla feel.** A lot of the time modlists can become ridiculously huge and bloated, but this modlist wants to be nice and lean. Less is more.
2. **Immersion is paramount.** I'm a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod as a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.  
3. **Mods must have decent longevity.** This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.  
4. **Stability is the most important thing.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.

## Essentials

There are some mods that every installation of Skyrim just needs to have. This includes a ton of fixes from **SKSE64** to **meh321**'s various engine-level fixes. I won't spend time talking much about this because I'm sure you're all aware of this and know what to expect. However, I will highlight some of the inclusions unique to Keizaal.

UI is very important because it effects all players. **SkyUI** and **RaceMenu** is a natural inclusion in virtually every installation of Skyrim on PC; however, some lesser-known UI extensions have been included in Keizaal. First and foremost is **moreHUD**, a great mod that gives the player more information outside of menus. This mostly comes in the form of tooltips before you pick up objects or the display of enemy level and soul size, this mod just gives players access to more information on the fly without needing to dig into more menus. **Extended UI** helps more easily digest the rather clunky skills menu, it places all the stats nicely on the bottom of the screen so it's easy to see you skill levels all at once. Lastly **Main Menu Design Replacer** just gives a different feel to the main menu we've been using all these years.

I like to cater to a lot of different people who want to play the game in different ways. One example of this is prespective. I don't think it's wrong to say that most people prefer to play in first-person, but I know there are many, including my wife, who actually like third person better. As such I've included a package of mods aimed to make the third-person experience feel more digestible. **SmoothCam** is the the heavy-hitter in this category, it completely changes how the third-person camera behaves. It is much more fluid and natural, making Skyrim feel so much better when playing in third-person. Additionally I have **Alternative Conversation Camera** packed into Keizaal as an optional mod to tick. It changes how dialouge is handled by locked onto the speaker and zooming in slightly. This works really well in third-person because it forces both the player and the NPC to actually look at eachother during the conversation, something that didn't really happen in Vanilla.

Lastly I have a short list of miscellaneous mods I wanted to talk about in this section. **BlockSteal** prevents the player from stealing any object unless they are actively sneaking, this is a very nice how to prevent you from accidently stealing some bread in front of the bartender and immediately getting arrested. **GIST - Genuinely Intelligent Soul Trap** improves the logic that the game uses when deciding which soul gem to place the soul you captured in, no longer will you have a bunch of Grand Soul Gems with Skeever souls. **To Your Face** adjusts NPC behavior so they won't blurt out random comments while you pass them in the street unless you're directly facing them.

## Graphics

Keizaal contains a large visual package to improve the visual fidelity of the game while sticking true to the original art style that Bethesda presented us. I use a mixture of **Project Clarity**, **aMidianBorn Book of Silence**, **Skyrim Realistic Overhaul**, **Osmodius** and **Noble Skyrim** as a base to build off of. From there I add on a wide array of texture and mesh replacer that are too numerous to list here individually. I will discuss some of the more noteworth inclusions.

The **Static Mesh Improvement Mod** serves as the base of my mesh replacers. It reworks a ton of Vanilla models to make them more three-dimensonal and believable. The **High Poly Project** covers a lot of other items that SMIM misses with a large selection of new models and textures. In addition to these mods there are several individual mesh replacers that help to complete the package, this includes but is not limited to mods such as **Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers**, **3d Pine Grass**, and **3D Snowberries**.

While the character models in Skyrim have aged much better than those in Oblivion, there is still room for improvement! I used **Tempered Males and Females** for the humanoid races and **Masculine and Femanine Khajiit and Argonians** for the beast races. Note that I chose to forgoe the nuditiy options because I want Keizaal to be a strictly safe for work list. I used a mixture of **Bed Head** and **High Poly Vanilla Hair** to try and improve Skyrim's glue-like hair, it is still not perfect but it is better than nothing. I have chosen to not use any hair replacers because they all either look super out-of-place in Skyrim or they lack the proper armor addons to make them work correctly with helmets and the like. However, **Hvergelmir's Aesthetics** and **Beast Hair Horn and Beard** do add a few new character creation options such brows and beards. Keizaal also includes **Weathered Nordic Bodypaints** and **Beast Race Bodypaints** for anyone that is into that. Lastly let's not forget the children! **Simple Children** is my sole child mod that covers everything quite nicely.
