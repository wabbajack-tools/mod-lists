# Relics of Hyrule - GAT Edition

The goal of this modlist is to be something fun and different rather than
your 100th enai-survival-rim playthrough.
Please check your immershun at the door and embrace that c0da makes it canon!

This modlist primarily revolves around [Relics of Hyrule](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12244) and [Grand Admiral Thrawn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24) with new monsters coming from a heavily modified version of [Rogue-Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872).

Combat is mostly handled by [AGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24296), [CGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767) and [SkyRe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17915). Enemy AI and new monsters are provided by [RLE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872) while both player and npc dodging come from The Ultimate Dodge Mod.

## Character Creation

Using [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) you can create a stunning looking character.

RGE currently ships with a preset for the Nord Female that makes your character resemble Linkle from Hyrule Warriors. We plan to add a Link and a Ganon preset as well. Thanks Frenchy!

## Getting Started in Game

The Relics of Hyrule content is very much explore and figure it out. There are no quests or markers to lead you on your way. Keep an eye and an ear open for glowing fairies and tinkling noises as those mark most locations of Hyrule content. You can find an initial piece of content in Riverwood near the bridge that Faendal paths across to chop wood.

The GAT content is woven into the main game. The imperial forces will be contesting you for everything including much of the major Hyrule content. At some point you will want to join the Chiss Resistance. While there are many ways to do this an easy one is to head towards Bleak Falls Barrow and stop at Riverwood's Folly to chat with the resistance members there about joining. I advise against actually doing anything with BFB until you've joined the resistance and they ask you to do so.

You may want to keep a companion or two with you at all times as GAT is balanced around having a squad. All vanilla followers have been significantly upgraded via 'Special Edition Followers'. Additionally I've included a funny old wizard 'Benjamin Doon', a nordic battle maid 'Danika', a vampire lord 'The Pale Lord', Auri and elven archer, an awesome lich 'Daanik', our favorite blue cat Inigo and last but not least Lucien. GAT itself comes with around thirty followers that you can recruit into your squad as well.

As configured by default your sneak key is ctrl, your dodge key is space and your shift key is jump. If you want to change this then go into the MAIN settings then controls then set the SNEAK key to whatever you want your DODGE to be. Then setup your jump to whatever it should be. Finally go into the MCM section for 'The Ultimate Dodge Mod' and set the sneak key to whatever you want to actually sneak with.

Spell Siphon is included in this modlist. It's an amazing way to play any mage/spellsword/arcane archer type character but it takes a bit of getting used to. If you want to make use of this feature then read the 'Spell Siphon' book in your inventory to kick things off. The payoff is huuuuuge.

Have fun!
