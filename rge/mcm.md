## MCM Configuration

**Wait until no new messages appear in the top left corner!**

I recommend starting by configuring ALL of your MCM menus EXCEPT for Skyrim Unbound. Once this is done open the console by pressing the grave ( ` ) key and typing 'save configured' Assuming you haven't made load order changes that break your saves then the next time you start a new character you can, from the main menu, open the console and type 'load configured' to start a new character without having to do all of your MCM choices again...

If it's not listed below then either the defaults are good enough (TUDM stamina costs for instance) or it's totally up to user preference. Work through all of the menus mentioned below while additionally customizing anything else as you see fit. Once that's done open up the 'Skyrim Unbound' MCM menu to choose your starting options...

In order to experience all of the GAT + Hyrule content I highly recommend that you start as a dragonborn character.

Either click 'Begin Your Adventure' or close the MCM menus and hit the 'enter' key to begin character creation.
