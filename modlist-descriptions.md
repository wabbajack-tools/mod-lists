## Skyrim Special Edition

### [Aldrnari](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=aldrnari)

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is a project to make a Skyrim **_I_** (Sovn) want to play. It is an ode to my love for folk music; in fact, the idea came when I began listening to [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music all together.

This 2200+ modlist is made to be challenging, rewarding, and, eventually, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies.
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

It has a plethora of quests, hundreds of handplaced new armors and weapons, new music, new companions and a completely overhauled worldspace. All of this is detailled in the rich **[Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md)** which dives deeply on what's to expect. Many of this changes are detailled and showcased in [this video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqaZN5j1eg)

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) with [Celtic Music in Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2980)
-   [Modern Combat Overhaul - ADXP | MCO](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distar/mods/attack) and [SCAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72014)

### [Alpyne](https://github.com/Ferroxius/Palette/blob/main/Alpyne_Installation.md)
Alpyne is a dark fantasy modlist for Skyrim AE. It offers a vibrant yet dramatic visual experience, refined gameplay complementing Skyrim's sandbox, and a more reactive world. It is also designed to be semi-lightweight, being performance friendly and small in installation size.

Explore, fight, affect. A dark fantasy awaits the itinerant.

### [Anvil](https://github.com/Althro/Anvil)

Anvil is designed as a forge for creating on. It can be used to build your own list, create mods, and also be played as is. It is fully documented with all changes and tweaks to mods being detailed in the `notes` part of Mod Organizer 2, and aims to be light in its footprint.

There are `Three` profiles in Anvil, each serving a distinct purpose.

`Anvil - Forge` is the most basic of profiles. It is designed as a mod development base with the Creation Kit and Plugin Development libraries being availiable. It can also serve as a "non-graphical" base for building a list off. It serves as the consolidated replacement of [Althro's Dev Tools](https://github.com/Althro/ADT).

`Anvil - Core` & `Anvil - Core CS` are the visual profiles, being for [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492) and [ENB](http://enbdev.com/news.html) respectively. Anvil's visual overhaul has an emphasis on "less is more" and improving what is already there. It serves as the replacement for [Althro's/Animonculory Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/Althro/Anvil).

### [Apostasy](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy)

Apostasy is a Wabbajack modlist for Skyrim SE that offers a modern, action-oriented combat system, custom tailored gameplay, and a consistent, high-fidelity graphics overhaul. Apostasy aims to deliver a cohesive and refined experience, enhancing both visuals and mechanics.

### [Arkay's Commandment](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=arkayscommandment)

My personal mod list that I play with, utilizing Requiem and 3Tweaks, focused on limiting explotative gameplay and crafting a consistently challenging adventure, all with 1 life only. The only way to advance is to utilize everything at your disposal, and as a player you'll need to have good mechanical skills and game knowledge.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)
-   [3Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44044)

---

### [Aurbaesence](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/)

Aurbaesence is a longtime effort to elevate the game to what I consider to be the perfect, modern Skyrim. Nearly everything in the game has been touched, in an effort to bring the game to a modern standard, and to make it a game I could play endlessly.

This modlist is highly focused on improving the 3rd person combat experience, while introducing a huge amount of new quests and locations, immense and curated equipment leveled lists with enchanted variants and adding dozens of new creatures to find in the world. Existing locations and quests have all been overhauled and improved upon, bringing the world of Skyrim to life.

While the combat experience can be likened to Dark Souls or other modern Action RPGs, the soul of this mod list resides in The Elder Scrolls. Every effort has been made to retain and improve upon the world building and lore of the series. Be sure to read our [Gameplay Guide](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/), and check out the [Notable Mods pages](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/notable-mods/) to fully understand the changes made by this modlist!

**Things to get familiar with:**
- [New Mechanics to Know](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/newmechanics/)
- [Major Questline Changes](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/questlinechanges/)

### [Do Not Go Gentle](https://github.com/Arkay-1248/Do-Not-Go-Gentle)

Do Not Go Gentle started off as a personal list that was built off of AVO-AE with Requiem. Eventually, I liked what I had built enough to share with others. You'll see a different choice of followers than the usual, quest additions, vanilla quest tweaks/enhancements, a full combat overhaul, a religion overhaul, along with npc replacers, a full visual overhaul based on AVO-AE, and lots of character customization options.

This list is designed as Requiem modlist with [Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), and lots of other additions to extend the life of your character playthrough. I did not build this to be a painful list to play, but Requiem does make you plan out your actions more than vanilla Skyrim. I find my build to be a reasonable balance between difficulty and enjoyment, and maybe you will too.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)
-   [Requiem - Noxcrab's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42591)

Like the original, it focuses primarily on visuals and is fully featured with hundreds of new additions and full Creation Club support—extending the base setup with [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s full suite of gameplay overhauls and various new quests and encounters.

### [Fahdon](https://github.com/Para0x/Fahdon-A-Skyrim-Together-Experience/)

Designed specifically with Skyrim Together Reborn in mind, each mod has been personally playtested and checked for desync issues and other general inconsistencies in multiplay. If you are looking for an experience inspired by systems found in Tabletop RPGs (i.e. D&D) then this is the list for you and your friends.

### [Halls of Sovngarde](https://www.modlists.net/docs/4hos/Home)

Halls of Sovngarde is a requiem based list which seeks to fully overhaul most elements of Skyrim entirely. With respects to Vanilla Skyrim, many of the old and beloved features of the game we all enjoy have been kept the same. On the other hand, areas which require updating and modernization have been put under the microscope, each minute detail modified to ensure the most modern and cohesive experience possible. This is not a vanilla list, nor is it a list which seeks to completely remove the original feel Skyrim gave us 12 years ago. This list will pay homage to the things we all grew to love while improving the look and overall feel.

Wildlander is a total conversion modpack for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that aims to bring the frozen north into your home.

The whole experience is built around Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul - 5.0.3. Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices and is made up of hundreds of publicly available mods made by almost as many talented mod authors. These mods have been carefully selected, tested, and tweaked by Dylan Perry to iron out any technical difficulties and maintain a consistent experience.

## Fallout 4


### [Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition (F4EE)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition)

F4EE is a hardcore experience built around Horizon. Survival difficulty is a mainstay for this list. Ammo, food, and water will all be much harder to find, and you’ll have to really think on your feet and take things slow if you want to survive. Overcoming great challenges is the name of the game here. Settlement building is a core mechanic of F4EE, and you will have a much more difficult time without it.

With options for a more vanilla+ style playthrough, as well as an even more challenging survival experience.

### [Whispering Chills - A Fallout 4 Experience](https://www.fallout4experiences.com/whispering-chills)

Whispering Chills is a horror experience unlike any other. It is intended to be entirely standalone in that you don't need to enjoy or know very well how to play Fallout 4 to be able to enjoy it as a horror fan in general. Perfect for anyone experiencing burnout in their other modded setups. It is about as "lore-unfriendly" as you can get purely using the engine as a vessel to craft an entirely new experience through a unique combination of mods that enhance/rework its core mechanics and add new content that entirely change its core focus. All vanilla quests and NPC's have been replaced with more thematically fitting horror variants.

Unlike most other Bethesda games where the horror element feels tacked on at best even using mods, the amazing modding community around this game has afforded us the opportunity to overhaul the Fallout 4 experience into an entirely unique other experience. The core premise revolves around an alternate vision of the Commonwealth where a door to the paranormal dimension has allowed for literal hell on earth to take over and has left very little remains in its wake. Your ultimate goal and place in this hellscape is for you to decide.

Most vanilla quests/NPC's and much of the base game content has been replaced with more appropriate dynamic systems for a zombie apocalypse playthrough with other missions/quests/objectives to lead you along your way.

Viva New Vegas is a modlist for Fallout New Vegas that will give you a perfectly stable, smooth and enjoyable experience. Its main features are:

-  Stability: The list includes all the latest and essential stability enhancements.
-  Performance: Every tool, setting, and mod in the list has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance.
-  Customizability: The list is split into 2 sections; all the mods required for the game to work and perform better are contained in the first section. The mods that can be considered subjective and that alter or add game content are in the VNV Extended section, which is fully modular.
-  Better Gameplay: As part of the VNV Extended section, the list includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's original intent. There is also an Overhauls section that will make the game much more difficult and add some new vanilla-friendly content. This section is highlighted by Vigor so it is not recommended for first time players.

## Tale Of Two Wastelands

### [Begin Again](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79547)

Begin Again is a mod list that focuses on bringing the gameplay feel of later Fallout titles into Fallout 3 and New vegas. Whilst being careful to preserve what made those games unique. Built on top of the fantastic [Tale Of Two Wastelands](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/download_ttw) this modlist serves to expand on what they have achieved by modernising certain aspects of the game that have not aged well and slightly rebalancing things where needed. 
If you have never played Fallout 3 or even New Vegas before then this is designed to be the definitive experience for a player used to some of the features of more modern games.

Why the name? Well Begin Again is a [song](https://youtu.be/NCkwAgTcDBw) featured in the new vegas DLC "Dead Money". It has long been one of my favourite songs from the series and I feel the title is also a nod to the user about beginning the game again!

Begin Again Features:

-   Full Ultrawide support

## Cyberpunk 2077

### [Welcome to Night City](https://www.wabbajack.org/modlist/CDPR_Modlists/CyberpunkTHING)

Night City is full of hardened gangoons with hair triggers and bad attitudes. But they've never run into anything like you.

The future of modding is here. You shouldn't need a degree from Arasaka Academy just to be able to enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 with mods. We provide not one, but two fully tailored and preconfigured modded experiences crafted from the best mods our team and the community at large have to offer.

The **Welcome to Night City** profile brings the vanilla balance you know and love with all the best mods. The **Cyberpunk THING** profile provides a more challening and immersive approach with a focus on realism. Switch between them at any time, for any reason, all remaining save safe.

## Baldurs Gate 3

### [Listonomicon](https://www.modlists.net/docs/7listo/Home)

Listonomicon exists to celebrate _Dungeons and Dragons_ past and present, bringing old and current published material (and limited, popular, third party, OSR, and Pathfinder) to Larians adaptation of 5e. It improves UI, QoL, and gameplay mechanics while adding new options, encounters, dangers, cosmetics, and fun. The goal is not to abandon what BG3 is fundamentally by forcing it into following book RAW rules.

- Brand new encounters throughout Act 1, 2, and 3
- Custom Combat Extender config to reinvigorate various vanilla encounters
- Several classes/subclasses, races, and subraces have been added without bloating the game with every random homebrew idea
- Tweaks to gameplay and balance to eliminate auto-pilot selection of Eldritch Blast to solve every encounter
- A reasonable bevy of cosmetic mods to provide new heads, hairs, skin tones, etc for base and modded races without abandoning BG3's art style or over-inflating the CC menu

Listonomicon eliminates the need to use LaughinLeader's BG3 Mod Manager. You can manage your load order in MO2 and launch the game.

### [Baldur's Gate 3 Enhanced Edition](https://github.com/reyqune/Baldur-s-Gate-3-Enhanced-Edition)

A minimalist curated Baldur's Gate 3 mod list that stays (somewhat) true to the vanilla experience but also a bit more difficult, featuring a handful of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and several visual enhancements for a smoother and more polished gameplay.
The list is meant to be played on the tactician mode difficulty, or higher. But there are options to play on lower difficulty by disabling the mod [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207).
It does deviate somewhat in order to have a bit more balance, most of which can be toggled off if you prefer, but I cannot guarantee that any such changes will work perfectly fine, as the list is intended to be played as is.


What is included:
https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/baldur-s-gate-3-enhanced-edition

- QoL additions and fixes for the UI
- Better CPU performance
- [Camera overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945)
- Some minor overhauls of the visuals, mostly fixes to minor issues.
- Gameplay changes are mostly QoL changes, and bug fixes to make the overall experience less tedious, and a few balance changes like via the mod [Relative Ability Boost Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11057).
- There are a few gameplay changes to increase the overall difficulty via the mod [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207)
- Other than that the rest of the changes are bug fixes, or fixes to parts of the game that seemed broken, but weren't technically bugs

What the list isn't:
- [Listonomicon](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8976), you should go play it instead if you want what it provides, say hello to the devs from me. <3
- additional races/classes
- changes that deviate way too much from the original experience designed by Larian
- adult mods, or frameworks
- a kitchen sink of every mod available on nexusmods, mashed together into one strange cursed mix
- cheats, unbalanced content, or too punishing content
- a list to play regular honour mode, use custom mode instead. There are too many issues to break the game without mods, and it's unpredictable how these mods will affect a genuine honour mode play-through

## Starfield

### [Melius](https://github.com/eljefe303030/Melius/blob/main/README.md)

Melius is a Starfield Wabbajack mod list originally based on [JaeDL's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/JaeDL?gameId=4187) excellent [Starborn Royalty](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6397) but now also has an optional profile based on [Ascension - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6839) and [Starvival - Immersive Survival Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6890). Main aim is to make the game as enjoyable as possible, whilst improving graphics, audio and adding quality of life mods.

Stability, a list that works irrespective of whether you have the Shattered Space DLC and is performance friendly, are other key aims of this list. Note: Starvival will only be enabled if you have the DLC.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

1. [El Jefe Combat AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13194) and [Bedlam](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10717) to make combat more fun and interesting
2. [Ascension - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6839) overhauls the gameplay in many ways. 
3. [Starvival - Immersive Survival Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6890) provides a fully working NEEDS mechanic with stages, new addictions, Spaceship Refueling and full list of other complimentary features. **This mod requires the Shattered Space DLC.**
4. [Rabbit’s suite of mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RabbitDoesStuff?gameId=4187) to make area lighting more realistic and playable i.e. not having to walk around in the dark when there are lights around you!
5. [Revelation - Main Quest Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10418) This mod overhauls Starfield's main quest, including removing most Temples. 
6. [Commitment (Keep Divorce Options)](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13436) Choose only Vanguard, Ranger or Ryujin Operative. Force disguise when undercover for SysDef. 
7. [Gorefield - A Starfield Gore Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12833) Introduces special death effects such as bodies exploding, disintegrating and burning. Options for this mod, including turning it on/off are in the Settings -> Gameplay Options. Will cause missing body textures around the necks of NPCs if used with [Simple Immersive Looting](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12677) when their heads have been blown off. Turn off headshot effects in the settings to avoid this.
