## Skyrim Special Edition

### [Aldrnari](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=aldrnari)

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is a project to make a Skyrim **_I_** (Sovn) want to play. It is an ode to my love for folk music; in fact, the idea came when I began listening to [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music all together.

This 2200+ modlist is made to be challenging, rewarding, and, eventually, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies.
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

It has a plethora of quests, hundreds of handplaced new armors and weapons, new music, new companions and a completely overhauled worldspace. All of this is detailled in the rich **[Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md)** which dives deeply on what's to expect. Many of this changes are detailled and showcased in [this video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqaZN5j1eg)

### [Animonculory Dev Tools](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/ADT/blob/main/README.md)

Designed as the mod author's tool kit, Animonculory Dev Tools (ADT) comes with all the tools you need to create and test your mods. Featuring mandatory DLL level fixes & libraries to build your own with, **native GOG and Steam compatability** and a few tweaks, it's the ideal playground to both work and build on.

**_Tools/Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Octagon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28773)

-   [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis)

---

### [Animonculory Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul)

Animonculory Visual Overhaul (AVO) is designed as a list to bring the vanilla game up to modern standards without changing the core vanilla feel and gameplay. Featuring graphical enhancements, mandatory bug fixes and tweaks and method patching, it is the perfect base to build upon.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Full Modlist](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/animonculory-visual-overhaul)

---

### [Arkay's Commandment](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=arkayscommandment)

My personal mod list that I play with, utilizing Requiem and 3Tweaks, focused on limiting explotative gameplay and crafting a consistently challenging adventure, all with 1 life only. The only way to advance is to utilize everything at your disposal, and as a player you'll need to have good mechanical skills and game knowledge.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)
-   [3Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44044)
-   [Skyrim Souls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859)

---

### [Do Not Go Gentle](https://github.com/Arkay-1248/Do-Not-Go-Gentle)

Do Not Go Gentle started off as a personal list that was built off of AVO-AE with Requiem. Eventually, I liked what I had built enough to share with others. You'll see a different choice of followers than the usual, quest additions, vanilla quest tweaks/enhancements, a full combat overhaul, a religion overhaul, along with npc replacers, a full visual overhaul based on AVO-AE, and lots of character customization options.

This list is designed as Requiem modlist with [Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), and lots of other additions to extend the life of your character playthrough. I did not build this to be a painful list to play, but Requiem does make you plan out your actions more than vanilla Skyrim. I find my build to be a reasonable balance between difficulty and enjoyment, and maybe you will too.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)
-   [Requiem - Noxcrab's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42591)

-   [Static Skill Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30410)

### [Elysium Remastered](https://github.com/TitansBane/Elysium-Remastered)

From TitansBane, the author of [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612), comes Elysium: what started as a simple off-shoot of The Phoenix Flavour has grown into its own massive undertaking. Elysium has taken its predecessor and packed it full of more content, including mods like [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194), a full suite of [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s mods, and an optional MO2 profile that supports all of your Creation Club content - all without sacrificing the stability that TPF is known for.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Immersive World Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18330)

### [Fable Lore](https://moddinglounge.com/fable-lore/)

Fable Lore is a Deleveled, modernized combat, survival focus approach modlist built with every aspect of modding. With stunning graphics, hundreds of gauranteed hours of playtime, new lands and entire storylines, you're bound to have an endless adventure in a better Skyrim modded experience. Built for every type of playstyle, from mages to warriors, every RPG aspect has been touched in some way to offer a more in-depth experience for any playstyle.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962)

Fable Lore _also_ comes with a custom add-on required for the Modlist, that delevels the entire world to a static level with various stats differentiating from each character you come across. Much of the world will be difficult, regardless of your level. If an enemy seems like they're going to be powerful, they likely are.

### [Fahdon](https://github.com/Para0x/Fahdon-A-Skyrim-Together-Experience/)

Designed specifically with Skyrim Together Reborn in mind, each mod has been personally playtested and checked for desync issues and other general inconsistencies in multiplay. If you are looking for an experience inspired by systems found in Tabletop RPGs (i.e. D&D) then this is the list for you and your friends.

### [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=TalesFromTheNorthernLands)

Tales from the Northern Lands is a list that focuses primarily on offering a stylized look similar to Borderlands, the Tales of/from … or the TellTale Walking Dead games.

The gameplay features a unique inventory overhaul that allows you to only focus on your armor, weapons and potions.

_Please note that Luca (the modlist author) does not support changes to the list, as this Basics profile was only made by request._

TSO is a finely-tuned modlist based on Requiem v1.9.4 and AZ Tweaks. Almost everything has been modified by hand, and is meant to be a challenging experience unlike any you’ve had before.

### [Wildlander](https://www.wildlandermod.com/download)

Wildlander is a total conversion modpack for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that aims to bring the frozen north into your home. Whether you want to call it immersion, realism, roleplaying, or simple masochism, the end-goal is to make you actually feel like an intrepid adventurer climbing snow-covered mountains, delving into ancient ruins, and getting yourself chased by packs of hungry wolves. The whole experience is built around Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul - 5.0.3. Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices and is made up of hundreds of publicly available mods made by almost as many talented mod authors. These mods have been carefully selected, tested, and tweaked by Dylan Perry to iron out any technical difficulties and maintain a consistent experience.

You ever thought Skyrim combat sucked? Yeah so did everyone. Tsukiro aims to bring combat to the next level with hundreds of hand-picked animations among a wide variety of weapon styles.

This won't just be your standard Skyrim playthrough with better combat though, hundreds of hours of additional quest content can be found through Legacy of the Dragonborn, Vigilant, Unslaad, Glenmoril, Interesting NPCs, The Shire, Maids 2: Deception, The Shadow of Meresis, Clockwork and more!

For the sexier side of things, you'll find most NPCs are more attractive than usual, including enemies. Full levelled list integration for hundreds of skimpy, sexy and spicy outfits. Can you collect them all?

And last but not least, the spicier side of things: Yamete provides a great advancement over the old defeat mods, an extra layer of punishment should you so desire. Also including 1000+ scenes for Sexlab including gay, group, Futa and creature support. Random scenes can also trigger via Scrappies Matchmaker (same author as Yamete) and Sexlab Solutions provides less violent ways to quest.

For a brief introduction to the combat and visuals please check the video here: [showcase and trailer here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2hlkN-OEqA)

### [Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition (F4EE)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition)

F4EE is a hardcore experience built around Horizon. Survival difficulty is a mainstay for this list. Ammo, food, and water will all be much harder to find, and you’ll have to really think on your feet and take things slow if you want to survive. Overcoming great challenges is the name of the game here. Settlement building is a core mechanic of F4EE, and you will have a much more difficult time without it.

### [Fallout 4 Modding Essentials](https://github.com/GozerBlackCat/FO4ME/blob/main/README.md)

Fallout 4 Modding Essentials (FO4ME) was made to act as a strong baseline for a larger load order. It includes fixes, mod prerequisites, and a simple to understand keywords and sorting system. It also includes some various weapons and armor patches, made by Lively, creator of [Magnum Opus](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=magnum_opus), or by myself.

### [Whispering Chills - A Fallout 4 Experience](https://www.fallout4experiences.com/whispering-chills)

Whispering Chills is a horror experience unlike any other. It is intended to be entirely standalone in that you don't need to enjoy or know very well how to play Fallout 4 to be able to enjoy it as a horror fan in general. Perfect for anyone experiencing burnout in their other modded setups. It is about as "lore-unfriendly" as you can get purely using the engine as a vessel to craft an entirely new experience through a unique combination of mods that enhance/rework its core mechanics and add new content that entirely change its core focus. All vanilla quests and NPC's have been replaced with more thematically fitting horror variants.

Unlike most other Bethesda games where the horror element feels tacked on at best even using mods, the amazing modding community around this game has afforded us the opportunity to overhaul the Fallout 4 experience into an entirely unique other experience. The core premise revolves around an alternate vision of the Commonwealth where a door to the paranormal dimension has allowed for literal hell on earth to take over and has left very little remains in its wake. Your ultimate goal and place in this hellscape is for you to decide.

There are also features around base-building and survivor rescue/recruitment if you are interested in the "rebuilding society" angle of things. Most vanilla quests/NPC's and much of the base game content has been replaced with more appropriate dynamic systems for a zombie apocalypse playthrough with other missions/quests/objectives to lead you along your way.

## Tale Of Two Wastelands

### [Begin Again](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79547)

Begin Again is a mod list that focuses on bringing the gameplay feel of later Fallout titles into Fallout 3 and New vegas. Whilst being careful to preserve what made those games unique. Built on top of the fantastic [Tale Of Two Wastelands](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/download_ttw) this modlist serves to expand on what they have achieved by modernising certain aspects of the game that have not aged well and slightly rebalancing things where needed. 
If you have never played Fallout 3 or even New Vegas before then this is designed to be the definitive experience for a player used to some of the features of more modern games.

Why the name? Well Begin Again is a [song](https://youtu.be/NCkwAgTcDBw) featured in the new vegas DLC "Dead Money". It has long been one of my favourite songs from the series and I feel the title is also a nod to the user about beginning the game again!

Begin Again Features:

-   Full Ultrawide support
-   Thanks to [Root Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720) all root mods are installed through MO2. Removing the need for the stock game folders as an added bonus!
-   A modern Interface thanks to [Vanilla UI +](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-plus) and customised [HUD Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67470) preset.

-   Quick bash mechanic similar to later Fallout titles thanks to [B42Bash](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68055)
-   Various tweaks to make the game more fluid thanks to [Stewies Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347)

## Cyberpunk 2077

### [Cyberpunk THING](https://www.wabbajack.org/modlist/CDPR_Modlists/CyberpunkTHING)

Cyberpunk 2077 is not a hard game. We decided to change that.

The aim is to make Cyberpunk the game it was always intended to be. More immersive, more realistic. A bullet's a bullet, and Night City is full of hardened gangoons with hair triggers and bad attitudes. But they've never run into anything like you.

More than just a collection of other modders' amazing work, we are actively developing new mods to add gameplay elements that support our vision. We provide a fully preconfigured and easy to use modded experience; it just works, plug n' play.
