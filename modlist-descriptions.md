## Skyrim Special Edition

### [Aldrnari](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=aldrnari)

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is a project to make a Skyrim **_I_** (Sovn) want to play. It is an ode to my love for folk music; in fact, the idea came when I began listening to [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music all together.

This 2200+ modlist is made to be challenging, rewarding, and, eventually, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies.
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

It has a plethora of quests, hundreds of handplaced new armors and weapons, new music, new companions and a completely overhauled worldspace. All of this is detailled in the rich **[Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md)** which dives deeply on what's to expect. Many of this changes are detailled and showcased in [this video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqaZN5j1eg)

### [Alpyne](https://github.com/Ferroxius/Palette/blob/main/Alpyne_Installation.md)
Alpyne is a dark fantasy modlist for Skyrim AE. It offers a vibrant yet dramatic visual experience, refined gameplay complementing Skyrim's sandbox, and a more reactive world. It is also designed to be semi-lightweight, being performance friendly and small in installation size.

Explore, fight, affect. A dark fantasy awaits the itinerant.

### [Anvil](https://github.com/Althro/Anvil)

Anvil is designed as a forge for creating on. It can be used to build your own list, create mods, and also be played as is. It is fully documented with all changes and tweaks to mods being detailed in the `notes` part of Mod Organizer 2, and aims to be light in its footprint.

There are `Three` profiles in Anvil, each serving a distinct purpose.

`Anvil - Forge` is the most basic of profiles. It is designed as a mod development base with the Creation Kit and Plugin Development libraries being availiable. It can also serve as a "non-graphical" base for building a list off. It serves as the consolidated replacement of [Althro's Dev Tools](https://github.com/Althro/ADT).

`Anvil - Core` & `Anvil - Core CS` are the visual profiles, being for [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492) and [ENB](http://enbdev.com/news.html) respectively. Anvil's visual overhaul has an emphasis on "less is more" and improving what is already there. It serves as the replacement for [Althro's/Animonculory Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/Althro/Anvil).

### [Apostasy](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy)

Apostasy is a Wabbajack modlist for Skyrim SE that offers a modern, action-oriented combat system, custom tailored gameplay, and a consistent, high-fidelity graphics overhaul. Apostasy aims to deliver a cohesive and refined experience, enhancing both visuals and mechanics.

### [Arkay's Commandment](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=arkayscommandment)

My personal mod list that I play with, utilizing Requiem and 3Tweaks, focused on limiting explotative gameplay and crafting a consistently challenging adventure, all with 1 life only. The only way to advance is to utilize everything at your disposal, and as a player you'll need to have good mechanical skills and game knowledge.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)
-   [3Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44044)

### [Aurbaesence](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/)

Aurbaesence is a longtime effort to elevate the game to what I consider to be the perfect, modern Skyrim. Nearly everything in the game has been touched, in an effort to bring the game to a modern standard, and to make it a game I could play endlessly.

This modlist is highly focused on improving the 3rd person combat experience, while introducing a huge amount of new quests and locations, immense and curated equipment leveled lists with enchanted variants and adding dozens of new creatures to find in the world. Existing locations and quests have all been overhauled and improved upon, bringing the world of Skyrim to life.

While the combat experience can be likened to Dark Souls or other modern Action RPGs, the soul of this mod list resides in The Elder Scrolls. Every effort has been made to retain and improve upon the world building and lore of the series. Be sure to read our [Gameplay Guide](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/), and check out the [Notable Mods pages](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/notable-mods/) to fully understand the changes made by this modlist!

**Things to get familiar with:**
- [New Mechanics to Know](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/newmechanics/)
- [Major Questline Changes](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/questlinechanges/)

- [Keyboard and Controller Bindings](https://aurbaesence.info/docs/mandatory-reading/gameplay-guide/importanthotkeys/)

---

### [Do Not Go Gentle](https://github.com/Arkay-1248/Do-Not-Go-Gentle)

Do Not Go Gentle started off as a personal list that was built off of AVO-AE with Requiem. Eventually, I liked what I had built enough to share with others. You'll see a different choice of followers than the usual, quest additions, vanilla quest tweaks/enhancements, a full combat overhaul, a religion overhaul, along with npc replacers, a full visual overhaul based on AVO-AE, and lots of character customization options.

This list is designed as Requiem modlist with [Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), and lots of other additions to extend the life of your character playthrough. I did not build this to be a painful list to play, but Requiem does make you plan out your actions more than vanilla Skyrim. I find my build to be a reasonable balance between difficulty and enjoyment, and maybe you will too.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

-   [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)
-   [Requiem - Noxcrab's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42591)

Like the original, it focuses primarily on visuals and is fully featured with hundreds of new additions and full Creation Club support—extending the base setup with [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s full suite of gameplay overhauls and various new quests and encounters.

### [Halls of Sovngarde](https://www.modlists.net/docs/4hos/Home)

Halls of Sovngarde is a requiem based list which seeks to fully overhaul most elements of Skyrim entirely. With respects to Vanilla Skyrim, many of the old and beloved features of the game we all enjoy have been kept the same. On the other hand, areas which require updating and modernization have been put under the microscope, each minute detail modified to ensure the most modern and cohesive experience possible. This is not a vanilla list, nor is it a list which seeks to completely remove the original feel Skyrim gave us 12 years ago. This list will pay homage to the things we all grew to love while improving the look and overall feel.

The **Welcome to Night City** profile brings the vanilla balance you know and love with all the best mods. The **Cyberpunk THING** profile provides a more challening and immersive approach with a focus on realism. Switch between them at any time, for any reason, all remaining save safe.

## Baldurs Gate 3

### [Listonomicon](https://www.modlists.net/docs/7listo/Home)

Listonomicon exists to celebrate _Dungeons and Dragons_ past and present, bringing old and current published material (and limited, popular, third party, OSR, and Pathfinder) to Larians adaptation of 5e. It improves UI, QoL, and gameplay mechanics while adding new options, encounters, dangers, cosmetics, and fun. The goal is not to abandon what BG3 is fundamentally by forcing it into following book RAW rules.

- Brand new encounters throughout Act 1, 2, and 3
- Custom Combat Extender config to reinvigorate various vanilla encounters
- Several classes/subclasses, races, and subraces have been added without bloating the game with every random homebrew idea
- Tweaks to gameplay and balance to eliminate auto-pilot selection of Eldritch Blast to solve every encounter
- A reasonable bevy of cosmetic mods to provide new heads, hairs, skin tones, etc for base and modded races without abandoning BG3's art style or over-inflating the CC menu

Listonomicon eliminates the need to use LaughinLeader's BG3 Mod Manager. You can manage your load order in MO2 and launch the game.

### [Baldur's Gate 3 Enhanced Edition](https://github.com/reyqune/Baldur-s-Gate-3-Enhanced-Edition)

A minimalist curated Baldur's Gate 3 mod list that stays (somewhat) true to the vanilla experience but also a bit more difficult, featuring a handful of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and several visual enhancements for a smoother and more polished gameplay.
The list is meant to be played on the tactician mode difficulty, or higher. But there are options to play on lower difficulty by disabling the mod [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207).
It does deviate somewhat in order to have a bit more balance, most of which can be toggled off if you prefer, but I cannot guarantee that any such changes will work perfectly fine, as the list is intended to be played as is.


What is included:
https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/baldur-s-gate-3-enhanced-edition

- QoL additions and fixes for the UI
- Better CPU performance
- [Camera overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945)
- Some minor overhauls of the visuals, mostly fixes to minor issues.
- Gameplay changes are mostly QoL changes, and bug fixes to make the overall experience less tedious, and a few balance changes like via the mod [Relative Ability Boost Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11057).
- There are a few gameplay changes to increase the overall difficulty via the mod [Combat Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5207)
- Other than that the rest of the changes are bug fixes, or fixes to parts of the game that seemed broken, but weren't technically bugs

What the list isn't:
- [Listonomicon](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8976), you should go play it instead if you want what it provides, say hello to the devs from me. <3
- additional races/classes
- changes that deviate way too much from the original experience designed by Larian
- adult mods, or frameworks
- a kitchen sink of every mod available on nexusmods, mashed together into one strange cursed mix
- cheats, unbalanced content, or too punishing content
- a list to play regular honour mode, use custom mode instead. There are too many issues to break the game without mods, and it's unpredictable how these mods will affect a genuine honour mode play-through

## Starfield

### [Melius](https://github.com/eljefe303030/Melius/blob/main/README.md)

Melius is a Starfield Wabbajack mod list based on [melik173's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/melik173?gameId=4187) excellent [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) and includes mods to make the game more immersive, combat more challenging and enjoyable, as well as adding in a number of quality of life mods and mods to improve the aesthetics. 

Stability and balanced gameplay that is challenging but rewarding are key aims of this list. 

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

1. [El Jefe Combat AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13194) and [Bedlam](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10717) to make combat more fun and interesting
2. [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) overhauls the gameplay in many ways.
3. [StarUI suite of mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/m8r98a4f2/mods?gameId=4187) to change the UI to make it easier and nicer to use.
4. Various mods to change the transitions and animations to make them more immersive and less annoying
5. [Rabbit’s suite of mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RabbitDoesStuff?gameId=4187) to make area lighting more realistic and playable i.e. not having to walk around in the dark when there are lights around you!
6. [Revelation - Main Quest Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10418) This mod overhauls Starfield's main quest, including removing most Temples.
7. [Simple Immersive Helmets](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4930) adds an overlay to the screen when wearing a helmet to provide reflections, as you could expect when having glass in front of you.
8. [Gorefield - A Starfield Gore Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12833) Introduces special death effects such as bodies exploding, disintegrating and burning.
9. Multiple mods that remove the chance of coming across the same POIs all the time.
10. [Deadly Hazards](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5800) Overhauls and fixes Starfield's environmental gameplay systems. If you have a yellow part of your health bar, it's environmental damage and needs to be healed by doctors or a Nanobots Injector.
11. [Vitality - Sustenance Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10536) This mod replaces the Sustenance system with a more gradual one, that includes sleep mechanics.
12. [Real Fuel - Immersive Exploration](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13306) Introduces Fuel usage mechanics to travel in Starfield in a lightweight and immersive manner.
13. [Real O2](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12303) A lightweight, highly compatible revamp of the O2 system in Starfield. Oxygen is now a limited resource in zero-atmosphere environments, and must be managed carefully.
14. [Better Boarding Encounters (BBE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13964) and [Enemies Boarding My Ship](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13999) Spices up docking encounters with surprise boarding, occasional hazards, and cut pirate dialogue! Enemies actively try to dock onto your ship during combat in order to board it. In space combat, there is now a constant risk of being boarded yourself. The risk increases with the interests of the factions and the condition of your ship.
15. [New Atlantis Awaits](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13614) Explore a revitalized version of New Atlantis with New Atlantis Awaits. This mod brings a complete overhaul to the city, enhancing its layout, architecture, and overall atmosphere.
