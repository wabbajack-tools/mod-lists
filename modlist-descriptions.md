## Skyrim Special Edition

### [NOIR - Nice Overall Improvement Requiem](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=noir)

NOIR is meant to serve two purposes: first, to introduce players to the world of Requiem inside of an environment full of enhanced graphics and new gameplay options; second, to serve as a potential base for veteran modders that wish to add various overhauls such as AZTweaks, 3Tweaks, and other complex mods.

### [TSO - Total Skyrim Overhaul](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tso)

TSO is a finely-tuned modlist based on Requiem v1.9.4 and AZ Tweaks. Almost everything has been modified by hand, and is meant to be a challenging experience unlike any you’ve had before. This is very much a game you are meant to experience for yourself without asking for a walkthrough, so be prepared to die a lot while you learn how best to handle the new mechanics.

### [RGE - Relics of Hyrule - Grand Admiral Thrawn Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=rge)

For those that have had enough of the “lore-friendly” lists and want something different, RGE boasts a massive 900+ mods, featuring items, characters, and references from both The Legend of Zelda and Star Wars universes.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

### [Elysium](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=elysium)

From TitansBane, the author of [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612), comes Elysium: what started as a simple off-shoot of The Phoenix Flavour has grown into its own massive undertaking. Elysium has taken its predecessor and packed it full of more content, including mods like [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194), a full suite of [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s mods, and an optional MO2 profile that supports all of your Creation Club content - all without sacrificing the stability that TPF is known for.

***

### [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=TalesFromTheNorthernLands)

Tales from the Northern Lands is a list that focuses primarily on offering a stylized look similar to Borderlands, the Tales of/from … or the TellTale Walking Dead games. A very welcome side effect of this is that it will even run on older hardware like a GTX 950 and possibly lower. And for people that are only interested in the visual changes made by the list, there is a “Basics” profile included you can use customize to your liking*. This is for if the various gameplay tweaks make the game too much of an easy “power fantasy” for you.

*Please note that Luca (the modlist author) does not support changes to the list, as this Basics profile was only made by request.*

### [Keizaal](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=keizaal)

Keizaal is a simple modlist that focuses on improving what is already presented to us in vanilla Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011.

***

### [The Phoenix Flavour](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tpf)

Automated installer for [The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com/), this is a list that would be considered a Vanilla+ experience and focuses on greatly improved graphics and enhancing existing gameplay mechanics instead of outright replacing them.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191)  
[Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549)

***

### [Living Skyrim](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=living_skyrim)

Living Skyrim aims to breathe life to the familiar emptiness of Skyrim, bringing tons of new characters to meet and interact with. Pair this with the new quests and character options, and you get a roleplay-focused and immensely replayable list.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

***

### [Serenity 2](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=serenity)

Serenity 2 is a Skyrim SE modlist that aims to bring a fresh Requiem Experience to the table. It uses Requiem 4.0.1 converted to Skyrim Special Edition and has minor and some major tweaks to the core Requiem experience that aims to enhance longevity and replayability while keeping the game fair, balanced and looking great. Serenity is targeted at new and veteran Requiem players and can offer new experiences to both sides of the playerbase. The list should run well on 1440p by utilizing 2K textures everywhere.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)  
[Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)

***

### [QWEST!](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=qwest)

QWEST! was born after a few friends were talking about how some of their friends couldn't enjoy cool quests in modded Skyrim, even with Wabbajack, due to the hardware requirements. This list overalls the game graphically, in a way that it does not impact fps.
It is Legacy of the Dragonborn centered, since it's the list with the most addons for it, with additions like music, animations, many new lands, many vanilla quest enhancers, better looking NPCs, unique followers and much more, tested to be ran perfectly fine by people with 2GB of VRAM graphic cards.
2 Profiles exists so you can choose between EnaiRim and SimonRim.
Survival mods such as The Frozen North, SunHelm and Campfire are toggleable and there's even a gamepad guide.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[EnaiRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)

Tinvaak is a modlist focused on revitalising and reworking Skyrim into an actual roleplaying game. Featuring T3NDO's Skyrim SE Redone, Skyrim Unbound, Oblivion influenced classes and birthsigns and an optional suite of survival mods, you can be anyone you wish. A second fully patched profile for Khajiit speak is included as well.

### [Aldrnari](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=aldrnari)

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is a project to make a Skyrim ***I*** (Sovn) want to play. It is an ode to my love for folk music; in fact, the idea came when I began listening to [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music all together.

This 1400+ modlist is made to be challenging, rewarding, and, eventually, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies. 
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

It has a plethora of quests, new armors and weapons, new music, new companions and a completely overhauled worldspace. All of this is detailled in the rich **[Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md)** which dives deeply on what's to expect.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

### [Arkay's Commandment](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=arkayscommandment)

My personal mod list that I play with, utilizing Requiem and 3Tweaks, focused on limiting explotative gameplay and crafting a consistently challenging adventure, all with 1 life only. The only way to advance is to utilize everything at your disposal, and as a player you'll need to have good mechanical skills and game knowledge. 

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

- [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)

### [(NSFW)Licentia(NSFW)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=Licentia)

A lightweight power fantasy list accessible to any level of gamer. Sexy without rubbing your nose in it. Imagine if Skyrim was prestige TV with excessive violence, boobs and sex scenes. Emphasizes questing and build diversity over collectibles and micromanagement.

## Fallout 4

***

### [Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition (F4EE)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition)

F4EE is a hardcore experience built around Horizon. Survival difficulty is a mainstay for this list. Ammo, food, and water will all be much harder to find, and you’ll have to really think on your feet and take things slow if you want to survive. Overcoming great challenges is the name of the game here. Settlement building is a core mechanic of F4EE, and you will have a much more difficult time without it.

### [Sim Settlements Experience](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=ssem)

This modlist is created entirely by a member of the Sim Settlements team, and is meant to be a showcase for both the mod itself and its vast array of potential additions. Really great list to build on top of, provided you don’t want the fuss of sorting through all the SS expansions and prefer to have that section done for you.

### [Magnum Opus](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=magnum_opus)

This list aims to greatly expand the content of Fallout 4 while keeping the original game fully intact. Featuring hundreds of new weapons and armors, dozens of quests and locations, tons of gameplay tweaks, and a custom sorting system, Magnum Opus will do its best to allow you to have fun in whatever way you want while still providing a moderate challenge.

### [Welcome to Paradise](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tpf-fo4)

Simply put, this list is what Fallout 4 should have been on release. Touting dozens of fixes, improved performance through rebuilt precombines, a custom expanded sorting overhaul, and a wide variety of customization options, Phoenix Flavour: Fallout is the definitive answer for someone that wants to experience the game as it was meant to be played.

### [Ultimate VR Essentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PhkPbhh0d8_ZoKj5mGBpmUIMU10c_7P94X9FpIuyak/edit)

### [Auriels Dream](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/blob/master/README.md)

Auriel's Dream is a warm welcome into modded SkyrimVR. The focus is mostly on staying true to the Vanilla game play, while giving a unique visual overhaul. There are no overhauls for trade, crafting, combat (except adding a few VR essentials), magic or perk trees by default. However, Some options are available in the optional categories.
