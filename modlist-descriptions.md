## Skyrim Special Edition

***

### [TSO - Total Skyrim Overhaul](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tso)

TSO is a finely-tuned modlist based on Requiem v1.9.4 and AZ Tweaks. Almost everything has been modified by hand, and is meant to be a challenging experience unlike any you’ve had before. This is very much a game you are meant to experience for yourself without asking for a walkthrough, so be prepared to die a lot while you learn how best to handle the new mechanics.

[TSO Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/NotTotal/Total-Skyrim-Overhaul/blob/master/README.md#gameplay-guide)

### [RGE - Relics of Hyrule - Grand Admiral Thrawn Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=rge)

For those that have had enough of the “lore-friendly” lists and want something different, RGE boasts a massive 900+ mods, featuring items, characters, and references from both The Legend of Zelda and Star Wars universes.

### [Elysium](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=elysium)

From TitansBane, the author of [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612), comes Elysium: what started as a simple off-shoot of The Phoenix Flavour has grown into its own massive undertaking. Elysium has taken its predecessor and packed it full of more content, including mods like [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194), a full suite of [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s mods, and an optional MO2 profile that supports all of your Creation Club content - all without sacrificing the stability that TPF is known for.

### [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=TalesFromTheNorthernLands)

Tales from the Northern Lands is a list that focuses primarily on offering a stylized look similar to Borderlands, the Tales of/from … or the TellTale Walking Dead games. A very welcome side effect of this is that it will even run on older hardware like a GTX 950 and possibly lower. The gameplay features a unique inventory overhaul that allows you to only focus on your armor, weapons and potions.

*Please note that Luca (the modlist author) does not support changes to the list, as this Basics profile was only made by request.*

Serenity 2 is a Skyrim SE modlist that aims to bring a fresh Requiem Experience to the table. It uses Requiem 4.0.1 converted to Skyrim Special Edition and has minor and some major tweaks to the core Requiem experience that aims to enhance longevity and replayability while keeping the game fair, balanced and looking great.

### [Aldrnari](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=aldrnari)

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is a project to make a Skyrim ***I*** (Sovn) want to play. It is an ode to my love for folk music; in fact, the idea came when I began listening to [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music all together.

This 1800+ modlist is made to be challenging, rewarding, and, eventually, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies. 
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

It has a plethora of quests, hundreds of handplaced new armors and weapons, new music, new companions and a completely overhauled worldspace. All of this is detailled in the rich **[Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md)** which dives deeply on what's to expect. Many of this changes are detailled and showcased in [this video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqaZN5j1eg)

### [Arkay's Commandment](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=arkayscommandment)

My personal mod list that I play with, utilizing Requiem and 3Tweaks, focused on limiting explotative gameplay and crafting a consistently challenging adventure, all with 1 life only. The only way to advance is to utilize everything at your disposal, and as a player you'll need to have good mechanical skills and game knowledge. 

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

### [Wildlander](https://www.wildlandermod.com/download)

Wildlander is a total conversion modpack for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that aims to bring the frozen north into your home. Whether you want to call it immersion, realism, roleplaying, or simple masochism, the end-goal is to make you actually feel like an intrepid adventurer climbing snow-covered mountains, delving into ancient ruins, and getting yourself chased by packs of hungry wolves. The whole experience is built around Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul - 4.0.2. Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices and is made up of hundreds of publicly available mods made by almost as many talented mod authors. These mods have been carefully selected, tested, and tweaked by Dylan Perry to iron out any technical difficulties and maintain a consistent experience.

### [(NSFW)Licentia(NSFW)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=Licentia)

A lightweight power fantasy list accessible to any level of gamer. Sexy without rubbing your nose in it. Imagine if Skyrim was prestige TV with excessive violence, boobs and sex scenes. Emphasizes questing and build diversity over collectibles and micromanagement.

### [(NSFW)Tsukiro(NSFW)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tsukiro)

You ever thought Skyrim combat sucked? Yeah so did everyone. Tsukiro aims to bring combat to the next level with hundreds of hand-picked animations among a plethora of weapon styles. With the Inpa-Sekiro mod, Sekiro-style combat elevates everything to a new level of lethality and action.

This won't just be your standard Skyrim playthrough with better combat though, hundreds of hours of additional quest content can be found through Legacy of the Dragonborn, Vigilant, Unslaad, Glenmoril, Interesting NPCs, The Shire, Maids 2: Deception, The Shadow of Meresis, Clockwork and more!

For the sexier side of things, you'll find most NPCs are more attractive than usual, including enemies. Full levelled list integration for hundreds of skimpy, sexy and spicy outfits. Can you collect them all? 

And last but not least, the spicier side of things: Yamete provides a great advancement over the old defeat mods, an extra layer of punishment should you so desire. Also including 1000+ scenes for Sexlab including gay, group, Futa and creature support. Random scenes can also trigger via Scrappies Matchmaker (same author as Yamete) and Sexlab Solutions provides less violent ways to quest.

For a brief introduction to the combat and visuals please check the video here: [showcase and trailer here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2hlkN-OEqA)

## Fallout 4

***

### [Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition (F4EE)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition)

F4EE is a hardcore experience built around Horizon. Survival difficulty is a mainstay for this list. Ammo, food, and water will all be much harder to find, and you’ll have to really think on your feet and take things slow if you want to survive. Overcoming great challenges is the name of the game here. Settlement building is a core mechanic of F4EE, and you will have a much more difficult time without it.

### [Magnum Opus](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=magnum_opus)

This list aims to greatly expand the content of Fallout 4 while keeping the original game fully intact. Featuring hundreds of new weapons and armors, dozens of quests and locations, tons of gameplay tweaks, and a custom sorting system, Magnum Opus will do its best to allow you to have fun in whatever way you want while still providing a moderate challenge.

### [Welcome to Paradise](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tpf-fo4)

Simply put, this list is what Fallout 4 should have been on release. Touting dozens of fixes, improved performance through rebuilt precombines, a custom expanded sorting overhaul, and a wide variety of customization options, Phoenix Flavour: Fallout is the definitive answer for someone that wants to experience the game as it was meant to be played.

### [Ultimate VR Essentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PhkPbhh0d8_ZoKj5mGBpmUIMU10c_7P94X9FpIuyak/edit)

The first official Skyrim VR list built for Wabbajack, UVRE’s primary goal is to provide users with a full visual overhaul tailored for Skyrim VR with all the adjustments and frameworks in place to serve as a base for further expansions and customizations, while also offering instant access to VR-centric mods like Spellsiphon and Weapon Throw VR.

### [Auriels Dream](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/blob/master/README.md)

Auriel's Dream is a warm welcome into modded SkyrimVR. The focus is mostly on staying true to the Vanilla game play, while giving a unique visual overhaul. There are no overhauls for trade, crafting, combat (except adding a few VR essentials), magic or perk trees by default. However, Some options are available in the optional categories. This makes the modlist easy to get into for people who are new to SkyrimVR, and it offers a good selection of optional mods for the more seasoned Skyrim player. Visually. the theme is a warmer atmosphere with an Oblivion-like vibe.

### [Diabolist VR](https://github.com/ex0-tekk/Diabolist-VR/blob/main/Readme.md)

Diabolist VR pays homage to the hack'n'slash loot hoarding ARPG of the late 90s, by adding 7 Diablo inspired mods, 67 additional dungeons, 100's of unique monsters, complete with a generous 3 tier loot system. Most creatures are randomly generated and respawn often for variation and you can adjust the Fine-Tuned Challange MCM settings to change overall difficulty. Optimizing DVR during development and testing was paramount and achieved via performance tools, mods, ini settings and using hybrid 3D trees with DynDOLOD 3 (low) @ 512k res, along with xLodGen Occlusion, this modlist should run very well on many HMD/PC configurations, with top notch visuals.

Welcome to DVR... More Monsters, More Loot!
