## Skyrim Special Edition

***

### [TSO - Total Skyrim Overhaul](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tso)

TSO is a finely-tuned modlist based on Requiem v1.9.4 and AZ Tweaks. Almost everything has been modified by hand, and is meant to be a challenging experience unlike any you’ve had before. This is very much a game you are meant to experience for yourself without asking for a walkthrough, so be prepared to die a lot while you learn how best to handle the new mechanics.

[TSO Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/NotTotal/Total-Skyrim-Overhaul/blob/master/README.md#gameplay-guide)

### [RGE - Relics of Hyrule - Grand Admiral Thrawn Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=rge)

For those that have had enough of the “lore-friendly” lists and want something different, RGE boasts a massive 900+ mods, featuring items, characters, and references from both The Legend of Zelda and Star Wars universes.

### [Elysium](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=elysium)

From TitansBane, the author of [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612), comes Elysium: what started as a simple off-shoot of The Phoenix Flavour has grown into its own massive undertaking. Elysium has taken its predecessor and packed it full of more content, including mods like [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194), a full suite of [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s mods, and an optional MO2 profile that supports all of your Creation Club content - all without sacrificing the stability that TPF is known for.

### [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=TalesFromTheNorthernLands)

Tales from the Northern Lands is a list that focuses primarily on offering a stylized look similar to Borderlands, the Tales of/from … or the TellTale Walking Dead games. A very welcome side effect of this is that it will even run on older hardware like a GTX 950 and possibly lower. The gameplay features a unique inventory overhaul that allows you to only focus on your armor, weapons and potions.

*Please note that Luca (the modlist author) does not support changes to the list, as this Basics profile was only made by request.*

### [Aldrnari](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=aldrnari)

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is a project to make a Skyrim ***I*** (Sovn) want to play. It is an ode to my love for folk music; in fact, the idea came when I began listening to [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music all together.

This 2000+ modlist is made to be challenging, rewarding, and, eventually, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies. 
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

It has a plethora of quests, hundreds of handplaced new armors and weapons, new music, new companions and a completely overhauled worldspace. All of this is detailled in the rich **[Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md)** which dives deeply on what's to expect. Many of this changes are detailled and showcased in [this video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqaZN5j1eg)

### [Arkay's Commandment](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=arkayscommandment)

My personal mod list that I play with, utilizing Requiem and 3Tweaks, focused on limiting explotative gameplay and crafting a consistently challenging adventure, all with 1 life only. The only way to advance is to utilize everything at your disposal, and as a player you'll need to have good mechanical skills and game knowledge. 

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

### [Wildlander](https://www.wildlandermod.com/download)

Wildlander is a total conversion modpack for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that aims to bring the frozen north into your home. Whether you want to call it immersion, realism, roleplaying, or simple masochism, the end-goal is to make you actually feel like an intrepid adventurer climbing snow-covered mountains, delving into ancient ruins, and getting yourself chased by packs of hungry wolves. The whole experience is built around Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul - 4.0.2. Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices and is made up of hundreds of publicly available mods made by almost as many talented mod authors. These mods have been carefully selected, tested, and tweaked by Dylan Perry to iron out any technical difficulties and maintain a consistent experience.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**
- [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888)

### [(NSFW)Licentia(NSFW)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=Licentia)

A kitchen-sink power fantasy list with tough enemies and an even tougher Dragonborn. Sexy without rubbing your nose in it. Legacy of the Dragonborn, full Creation Club required, piles of mobs packing every surface and loot and artifacts stashed in every corner. Way more ridiculous stuff than you'd ever find the time for.

**_Mods to get familiar with_**

### [(NSFW)Tsukiro(NSFW)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tsukiro)

You ever thought Skyrim combat sucked? Yeah so did everyone. Tsukiro aims to bring combat to the next level with hundreds of hand-picked animations among a plethora of weapon styles. With the Inpa-Sekiro mod, Sekiro-style combat elevates everything to a new level of lethality and action.

This won't just be your standard Skyrim playthrough with better combat though, hundreds of hours of additional quest content can be found through Legacy of the Dragonborn, Vigilant, Unslaad, Glenmoril, Interesting NPCs, The Shire, Maids 2: Deception, The Shadow of Meresis, Clockwork and more!

For the sexier side of things, you'll find most NPCs are more attractive than usual, including enemies. Full levelled list integration for hundreds of skimpy, sexy and spicy outfits. Can you collect them all? 

And last but not least, the spicier side of things: Yamete provides a great advancement over the old defeat mods, an extra layer of punishment should you so desire. Also including 1000+ scenes for Sexlab including gay, group, Futa and creature support. Random scenes can also trigger via Scrappies Matchmaker (same author as Yamete) and Sexlab Solutions provides less violent ways to quest.

For a brief introduction to the combat and visuals please check the video here: [showcase and trailer here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2hlkN-OEqA)

## Fallout 4

***

### [Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition (F4EE)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition)

F4EE is a hardcore experience built around Horizon. Survival difficulty is a mainstay for this list. Ammo, food, and water will all be much harder to find, and you’ll have to really think on your feet and take things slow if you want to survive. Overcoming great challenges is the name of the game here. Settlement building is a core mechanic of F4EE, and you will have a much more difficult time without it.

### [Somnium](https://www.scenicroute.games/projects/somnium)

From the same team that brought you Librum SE and Librum VR, Somnium is a total conversion of Enderal's mechanics, graphics, and atmosphere, designed to bring the gameplay and visuals up to par with Enderal's first-rate stories and setting. Specifically, Somnium casts the game into an Age of Sail setting, complete with all-new, custom third-person shooter mechanics; new and remastered assets and locations; and a complete re-imagining of all game mechanics. Moreover, the game is built upon a new horror framework in the form of _Apoapse's Anomalies_, turning Enderal's fantasy elements into something more reminiscient of Lovecraftian horror.
